    "3. The first letter of the **Class_name** is often capitalized. This is a tradition in defining classes.\n",

    "4. *parent_class* indicates the partent class of the defined class. Parent class is the class being inherited from. Child class is the class that inherits from another class (https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_inheritance.asp ). For example, we define a Pet class and a Dog class inherited from Pet class. Here, the Pet class is the parent class. The Dog class is the child class. The parent class is more general than the child class. This is, **the child class objects are the subset of the parent class objects.** \n",

Here we pass the object, i.e. self, to the methods)\n",
